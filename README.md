# Dungeons-Weapons-Generator

This project is a simple weapon name generator for Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) that uses a list of prefixes and suffixes to create fun and humorous weapon names.

## Installation

To use this weapon name generator, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website.

## Usage

To generate a new weapon name, simply run the `weapon_name_generator.py` script. This will randomly select a prefix and suffix from the included lists and combine them to create a new weapon name.

You can also modify the included lists to add or remove prefixes and suffixes as desired. Just make sure to keep each prefix and suffix on its own line in the corresponding text file.
